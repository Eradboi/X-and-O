# X AND O GAME

X and O Game is a Pygame (Python) 3 by 3 tic-tac-toe game that can either be two player or against the computer.

## Installation
Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) now.
Then install the pygame on the teriminal

PS: Please ignore the 'Online' that I put on the intro display interface because I couldn't make it happen... yet.
Thanks, Enjoy.
